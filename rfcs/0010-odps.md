# Open Data Product Standard (ODPS)

Champion: Jean-Georges Perrin

## Summary

Create a standard for data products.

## Motivation

* Data products are not normalized.
* Various standards are emerging and are competing: they are not following open processes & foundations.
* They are not leveraging ODCS.

## Design and examples

### Principle
A data product should be able to evolve, hence include several versions of a data contract.

### Back story
Cindy is a data engineer building a data product.

The two input data sources are identified by two data contracts, which IDs are `560525a6-0bd3-4aff-905f-39589c8c838e` and `341b02d1-5e52-4186-a20e-74ffc31997d2`. The output port is governed by another data contract identified by `af12347d-b730-48e5-a369-33a2c70fd95b`.

In the first iteration of the data product, Cindy wants:

| Input id | Input version | Output id | Output version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|560525a6-0bd3-4aff-905f-39589c8c838e|1.2.0|af12347d-b730-48e5-a369-33a2c70fd95b|1.0.0|
|341b02d1-5e52-4186-a20e-74ffc31997d2|1.0.0|||


### Format

TBD.


## Alternatives

N/A.

## Decision

TBD.

## Consequences

New standard, no impact on existing.
