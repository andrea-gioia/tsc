# Open Data Product Standard (ODPS)

Champion: Jean-Georges Perrin

## Summary

Create a standard for data products.

## Motivation

* Data products are not normalized.
* Various standards are emerging and are competing: they are not following open processes & foundations.
* They are not leveraging ODCS.

## Design and examples

### Principle
A data product should be able to evolve, hence include several versions of a data contract.

### Back story
Cindy is a data engineer building a data product.

The two input data sources are identified by two data contracts, which IDs are `560525a6-0bd3-4aff-905f-39589c8c838e` and `341b02d1-5e52-4186-a20e-74ffc31997d2`. The output port is governed by another data contract identified by `af12347d-b730-48e5-a369-33a2c70fd95b`.

In the first iteration of the data product, Cindy wants the two data sources.

| Input id                             | Input version | Output id                            | Output version |
| ---                                  | ---           | ---                                  | ---            |
| 560525a6-0bd3-4aff-905f-39589c8c838e | 1.2.0         | af12347d-b730-48e5-a369-33a2c70fd95b |1.0.0           |
| 341b02d1-5e52-4186-a20e-74ffc31997d2 | 1.0.0         |                                      |                |

This would result in:

```YAML
name: my data product
uuid: fbe8d147-28db-4f1d-bedf-a3fe9f458427
kind: DataProduct
apiVersion: 1.0.0
versions:
- version: 1.0.0
  in:
  - contractUuid: 560525a6-0bd3-4aff-905f-39589c8c838e
    version: 1.2.0
  - contractUuid: 341b02d1-5e52-4186-a20e-74ffc31997d2
    version: 1.0.0
  out:
  - contractUuid: af12347d-b730-48e5-a369-33a2c70fd95b
    version: 1.0.0
 
```
