# Guiding Values

Guiding values help the Technical Steering Committee to make decisions what to include, and how to include things in the standard.

## Principles

- We favor a small standard over a large one
  - Instead of adding every field to the standard, go more in favor of allowing extensions
  - Keep the standard small, so it remains simple
- We favor interoperability over readability
  - Tool interoperability (import/export) is crucial for the success of the standard
  - Developers, however, should still be able to read and write the YAML format
